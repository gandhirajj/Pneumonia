Pneumonia Detection Using CNN + LSTM Hybrid Model

This project implements a deep learning model to detect pneumonia from pediatric chest X-ray images using a hybrid architecture that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras and evaluated on test data with visual metrics and performance reports.

üß† Deep Learning Architectures

üåÄ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

CNNs are powerful deep learning models designed specifically for image data. They apply convolutional filters to input images to extract spatial features such as edges, textures, and patterns.

Key Components:
- Conv2D layers: Apply filters that learn to recognize visual features.
- MaxPooling2D: Downsample feature maps to reduce dimensionality and computational cost.
- Activation Functions: Commonly ReLU, which introduces non-linearity.

Why CNN?  
CNNs are excellent at learning spatial hierarchies in image data, which is essential for understanding medical images like chest X-rays.

üîÅ Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

LSTMs are a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that excel at learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. Unlike standard RNNs, LSTMs solve the vanishing gradient problem and remember patterns over longer sequences.

Key Components:
- Memory Cell: Maintains a memory of previous states.
- Gates (Forget, Input, Output): Control the flow of information.

Why LSTM in Image Tasks?
Although LSTMs are primarily used for sequences like text or time series, they can also be applied to image data when the image is reshaped into a sequence (e.g., by treating rows or feature vectors as timesteps). This allows the model to learn spatial sequences across image features.

üîó CNN + LSTM Hybrid Model

This architecture combines CNN and LSTM to leverage the best of both worlds:

1. CNN extracts spatial features from X-ray images.
2. Reshape Layer converts the CNN output into a sequence.
3. LSTM processes the sequence to learn temporal/spatial dependencies across feature maps.
4. Dense Layers make the final classification.

Advantages:
- CNN captures local features like shapes and textures.
- LSTM captures relationships across regions, such as the spread of pneumonia patterns in the lungs.



üîç 1. Image Classification
Concept:
Classifying an image into predefined categories (here: Normal vs Pneumonia).

Requires understanding the spatial patterns and features present in medical images (chest X-rays).



üß† 2. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
Purpose:
Automatically learn and extract spatial features from images (e.g., edges, blobs, textures).

Components Used:
Conv2D: Applies filters over the image to detect patterns.

MaxPooling2D: Downsamples feature maps, reducing size and computation.

Activation Function (ReLU): Introduces non-linearity to learn complex functions.

He Initialization: Helps with weight initialization to maintain stable gradient flow.

Why used?
CNNs are highly effective for image data and are the backbone of most visual recognition tasks.



üîÅ 3. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
Purpose:
Learn sequential dependencies ‚Äî typically in time-series or language tasks, but here it's used on reshaped image features.

Components Used:
LSTM Layer: Processes a sequence of feature vectors (produced from CNN) and captures temporal relationships across them.

Why used?
In this project, the CNN's output is reshaped into a sequence, and LSTM is used to understand long-range dependencies across different parts of the image.

It allows the model to understand contextual spatial relationships, especially helpful in detecting subtle pneumonia spread patterns.



üîó 4. CNN + LSTM Hybrid Architecture

Why combine them?
CNN: Learns local patterns like edges and shapes (important for lung structure).

LSTM: Learns global dependencies across different regions in the image (e.g., the spread of infection).
